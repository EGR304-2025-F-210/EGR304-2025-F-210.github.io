## Team Introduction
> Hello! We are group 4 students at Embedded Systems Design class and we are here to showcase our updates on the team project.<br>
>    * We are developing very cheap environmental monitoring device that measures water and air quality using conductivity, pH, and opacity sensors. This system provides real-time feedback to help users easily identify unsafe environmental conditions and promote healthier living. We will update the website on daily basis as new project updates will be available.<br>
>    * Stay tuned to see more great things and review our individual GitHub pages for more information.

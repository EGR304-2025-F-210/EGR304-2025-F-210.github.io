## Team Introduction
> This is the project website of VibeWater (EGR304 Group 210). We are a team of four engineering students working to develop a low-cost, modular, easily manufacturable water quality measuring device for anyone to test their water supply. We are focusing on measuring inorganic contamination and creating an easy-to-use solution that does not need any kind of background or training to run.
> Our system currently includes modules for measuring water conductivity, pH, and opacity, along with a user interface device.

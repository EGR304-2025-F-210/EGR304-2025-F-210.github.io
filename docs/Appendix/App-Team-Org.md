## Team Goals

1. Meets an actual market need (Not the digital/elecctronic equivalent of a Labubu)
2. Is profitable (Whether we sell many units or high margin)
3. Reasonable scope of project so we can finish it
4. Improving skills in Embedded power systems 
5. Learning more about embedded systems, coding, sensors, and learning about smaller electronic devices rather than larger circuits, more solid state stuff.

Our mission is to design and deliver a practical, market-relevant embedded power systems project that balances commercial viability with educational growth. By focusing on achievable scope, profitability, and real-world need, we aim to sharpen our skills in embedded systems, coding, sensors, and solid-state electronicsâ€”building both technical expertise and entrepreneurial insight while completing a product that genuinely serves its users.

### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on our discussion, we decided to use Discord as we can access it from both mobile and desktop devices as well as file share on the platform 

## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?
We will message over discord, members are expected to check at least once every 24 hours unless specifed that they will not be available. On a regular working day (School days/weekdays 8am to 8pm) members are expected to be able to check messages every 24 hours and respond within 48. 

2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
Neel is appointed to email with the instructor to relay the group's issues. Neel will message the discord.

## Roles & Responsibilities

| **Role**          | **Duties**                                                                                                                                |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meeting leader: K Phang    | Schedules team meetings, creates and distributes an agenda for each meeting, and runs each meeting                                        |
| Meeting recorder: Neel  | Takes minutes of each team meeting, including attendance, and records action items and to whom they are assigned                          |
| Assignment leader: Asadbek | Coordinates the team's work on a given assignment to Canvas before the due date                                                           |
| Project monitor: Jacob   | Tracks the team's progress relative to the project schedule (Gantt chart) and keeps team members apprised of deadlines and project status |

## Team Coordination & Accountability
To ensure each member is satisfied with an assignment, we will all create one unique aspect of the assignment and designate someone on the team to submit the assignment before the deadline. Each member will be reminded to review class lectures and the textbook if he is unfamiliar with the concepts presented in the assignment. If his level of knowledge is still low, a team member that is more familiar with concept will help. If the entire team is unfamiliar, some portion of or the entire team will attend office hours.

In order to ensure design feedback is reviewed, major changes will be made aware to the whole team as soon as feasible. Each member of the team will be assigned certain portions of assignments that can fit with his workload outside of the team project. We will attempt to split the semester's workload evenly across the whole semester, but also realize that people's lives may change at random times. Everyone will be expected to be aware of the project status, which will help make sure everyone is doing their assigned tasks and picking up the slack when need be.

If a team member is found to be underperforming, the rest of the team will check on him to make sure everything is ok. If the workload is too much at the moment, we will coordinate to move some tasks around to ease the burden. If the team member is choosing to underperform, we will handle the issue internally. If a team member has to be talked to more than 3 times about their choosing to underperform, someone from the teaching team will be involved in the next discussion. If the team member continues to choose to underperform, he will be given a pink slip, so the rest of the team can keep moving forward.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

We will talk professionally and do our assignments on time and meet our responsibilities. If there are going to be conflicts on any reason, we will discuss and try to resolve like mature adults and put the project success first.

## Team Goals

Lmeets an actual market need (Not the digital/elecctronic equivalent of a Labubu)
Is profitable (Whether we sell many units or high margin)
Reasonable scope of project so we can finish it
Improving skills in Embedded power systems 
Learning more about embedded systems, coding, sensors, and learning about smaller electronic devices rather than larger circuits, more solid state stuff 

Our mission is to design and deliver a practical, market-relevant embedded power systems project that balances commercial viability with educational growth. By focusing on achievable scope, profitability, and real-world need, we aim to sharpen our skills in embedded systems, coding, sensors, and solid-state electronicsâ€”building both technical expertise and entrepreneurial insight while completing a product that genuinely serves its users.

### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on our discussion, we decided to use Discord as we can access it from both mobile and desktop devices as well as file share on the platform 

## Communication Procedures

1. How will your team communicate?
We will message over discord, members are expected to check at least once every 24 hours unless specifed that they will not be available. On a regular working day (School days/weekdays 8am to 8pm) members are expected to be able to check messages every 24 hours and respond within 48. 

2. How will you handle instructor correspondence? Who is responsible? How will that be communicated with/back to the group?
Neel is appointed to email with the instructor to relay the group's issues. Neel will message the discord.

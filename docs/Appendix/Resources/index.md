The video below shows the final state that we were able to acheive for our project. Unfortunately due to multiple class-wide setbacks, we as a team were unable to progress to finish it fully with final components to our Printed Circuit Boards or creating a model door to show ideal functionality. However, we did a lot of effort as we could with the time and resources we were given. Ultimately, we assembled our individual systems on breadboards, programmed them, and established full connectivity between all components. All four subsystems were integrated using a shared power source and communicated with one another to operate exactly as intended.

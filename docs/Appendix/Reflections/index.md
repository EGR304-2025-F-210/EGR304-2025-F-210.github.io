## Lessons Learned

**1. Need to learn more coding**

Since not everyone in our team was familiar with lots of coding in C language, we needed to make our subsystems work.<br><br>

**2. Connecting with different microcontrollers**

It was very good learning for us about using 4 different microcontrollers and connecting those through DAC/ ADC and UART. By transmitting and receiving data in our subsystems, we learned a lot.

<br><br>

**3.  Github datasheet**
It was a very interesting journey to work with GitHub and make updates to the website. We learned a lot about the Github throughout this semester. All of the updates to our subsystems were available online. 
<br><br>

**4. External Design Review**
Our team prepared very well to make the design review very good. We presented our project and datasheet well and received their feedback. We learned a lot about our components and about presenting our subsystem to the professionals and the teaching team.
<br><br>

**5. Time commitment**
This class requires at least 7 hours per week on average of time allocation to be able to successfully finish all assignments and make the subsystems work. There will be days and weeks when your team will need to meet more to discuss design review, subsystems coding.
<br><br>

**6. Nothing needs to be perfect**
We did not need to make the project perfect, but we did need to make it work and learn from it. We need to do our best and ensure that our subsystems work well.
<br><br>

**7. Showing up is required**
Many updates about the assignments and requirements for the subsystems are presented in class, and make sure that you do not miss any class or any lab. Even missing 1 class can make you behind of your project and lab. Do not come late, and if class finishes early, make sure that you try to spend to discuss team assignments and work on completing those.
<br><br>

**8. Following rubric**
Since many assignments have a fixed rubric, to maximize points, it is highly important that you try to follow all the requirements the assignment rubric says. Team assignments have big webpages with all the data about proper submission. We learned that everyone in the team needs to read it before starting the assignment, because it is very easy to miss a point or two.
<br><br>

**9. Start on breadbord**
Since the Peralta lab did not work, our PCB did not arrive on time, and we had to reorder through JLCPCB. We needed to make the breadboard work. We learned that putting our subsystem first on the breadboard before sending it to make a PCB would help us so much in the process of finding flaws before sending for PCB printout.
<br><br>

**10. Block diagram**
We needed to look over the block diagram as we had misalignments with what the PIC microcontroller has to offer. We believe that starting to work on our block diagram earlier would have been very benefitial, so we do not need to remake it.

## Recommendations for future students
The following are Team VibeWater's top 5 recommendations for future students taking this class next semester.

**1. Send PCBs early.**
Since this class teaches the knowledge on how to make PCBs. You must start making your subsystem PCB early, and if you send it early to the Peralta lab, you will be on time for the hardware check-off. If you are taking this class in the fall, we would suggest making sure that you are ready for check off with PCB before Thanksgiving.
<br><br>

**2. Start Github assignments early**
Since you will most probably need to submit your datasheet assignments, your team needs to make sure that you do those assignments on time and submit them without flaws. You need to make sure that you use the Canvas link submission tool, which takes a snapshot of when your website was there.
<br><br>

**3. Communicate always**
Since you will be in a team of 4, communicating about updates to the assignments is important. Make sure that you meet every week to discuss assignments and assign tasks to each other to be on the same page.
<br><br>

**4. Attend office hours**
Office hours are constructive to learn about questions you have. Since you will need to make boards communicating with each other and make team block diagrams, you might have many questions when dealing with them. TAs and professors are very helpful during the office hours.
<br><br>


**5. Plan better:**
As our team chose a bit hard project, we sugegst to ensure that you make your project realistic, since you have other classes, work, and other things to do outside of this class. Ensure that whatever project you choose is either something you are passionate about or that you have an idea of what to do with it.

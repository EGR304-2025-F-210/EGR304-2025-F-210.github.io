## Lessons Learned
The following are the top 10 most important things that our team learned from working on this project. 

**The most important thing is to always "start early".**

**2. Github Documentation skills:**

We used Github to make updates to our project and it boosted our skills needed for embeddes systems design and we will probably use it during career. A lot of assignments like Design review worth a lot of points and you need to make sure that you make updates to your website weeks or days before the design review deadline so that your VS code won't crush because everyone in the team is working on it 2 hours before it is due.<br><br>

**2. ECAD Experience:**

Many of our group members had not used, or only lightly used, ECAD software before this class. Throughout the class, we discovered how to select the needed components, route connections, and create and assign custom footprints and symbols. Throughout this class, we have gained the skills to use ECAD properly to make a functional PCB. This will likely be helpful in future classes, and possibly in future career paths.

**3. Collaboration:**

Since all of our boards had to be able to communicate with each other, collaboration was an important part of this project. Our group had to ensure that our pins for the ribbon cables matched up and that we were all on the same page when it came to communication protocols between boards. This is a good skill to have learned throughout the project, as no matter what field you end up in, there is likely to be a lot of collaborative efforts between individuals.

**4. Prototyping:**

To ensure that our boards worked before sending in the order for manufacturing, many labs were done throughout this class to allow us to understand how to use the electrical components we were given. This allowed us to be sure that our designs would work before the PCBs were created. Because of this, all of our boards more or less worked right after assembly, with only minor hiccups in the process. Prototyping is a useful skill, and ensures that time, money, and effort are not wasted on a malfunctioning device.

**5. Filtering analog signals with op-amps:**

<br><br>

**6. Design ideation:**

<br><br>

**7. Communication between multiple microcontrollers:**

One requirement of this project was that all 4 of our boards had to be able to communicate with each other. To accomplish this, our group had to decide on what sort of communication protocol we wanted to use and then implement it.
<br><br>

**8. PCB design principles:**

Most of us never worked on making PCBs and it was very good skills. We learned a lot about annular width, and how to ensure that our designs are aligned with the manufacturing requirements of Peralta, doing DFM checks with JLCPCB. We hope to use this skills in our final year project classes and beyond.
<br><br>

**9. Workload allocation:**

Since this assignment was a group project, our group had to develop our skills in allocating different parts of the assignment to each other. Each of us had to make sure we were communicating well with other group members and planning out who would do what and when. As many classes and occupations involve division of labor, this skill is yet another useful one to hone.
<br><br>

**10. Creating Improvements from Feedback:**

Throughout this project, our group was given feedback several times. A large part of this project was taking that feedback and using it to improve and refine our design and documentation. The ability to revise and improve is another useful skill that this project helped to teach.

## Recommendations for future students
The following are our top 5 recommendations for future students taking this class.

**1. Start early and ask questions:**

Our team had issues with software and hardware although Peralta lab for PCB manufacturing did not work for 1 week and it took lots of time for PCB to arrive. Ask questions about the assignments from professors and graders. Coming and showing up to classes is the key because professors will tel you almost every requirement you need to follow to make your subsystem working.
<br><br>


**2. Make sure your PCB has correctly sized drill holes:**

Some of the footprints look fine in KiCad or Cadence, but when printed opamps, PIC might not fully fit. Make sure to fully measure and make printed 1:1 version before sending ti manufacture it. <br><br>


**3. Do well on the GitHub assignments:**

The GitHub documentation assignments in this class are plentiful. There's a lot to do, and the GitHub assignments are actually worth significantly more than actually having a working device pointwise. Because of this, it's very important to make sure you do well on the GitHub assignments. Since the cumulative GitHub document is graded twice throughout the semester, any mistake made in previous sections can affect your grade multiple times.

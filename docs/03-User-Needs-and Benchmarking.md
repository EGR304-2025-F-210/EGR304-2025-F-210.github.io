| "How much is your home worth? How much is YOUR LIFE, and the lives of those you love, really worth? This dual-function unit would be worth the protection it provides at DOUBLE the price. It is SO simple to use, yet so much better than cheaper units. It will show a reading of gas on its continuous display, BEFORE the amount will set off the alarm! This make it superior to any kind of alarm I have ever purchased before. Do you use natural gas for cooking or heating in your home? Then why are you still just sitting there reading? You NEED this alarm. Stop thinking of the price difference, for crying out loud. Your home AND your life are both PRICELESS. Be smart and responsible. BUY THIS UNIT NOW!

| "I had an all home generator installed which included our propane company to come perform a leak check. They found a significant leak in my home and took measures to repair. They recommended I purchase a detector -- I informed them I had three (3) in my home; one on each floor. They gasped. I showed them where the main floor detector was plugged in -- again gasped. The service employee said the one of the three should absolutely have picked up the leak as one detector was right above the leak and the basement detector was right below. Never did either go off and I check the readout's constantly as they are in my sight when walking by. Not impressed . . . at all.

| "Wanted mom to drink my filtered water I get from my rain barrel and clean. Said store bought is better. I got several layers of filters to clean it more and she said no, but dad loved it. Then got a UV-C light to get 100% comfort on disinfection. Mom still said no.

So got this to prove the cleanliness of the water and checked a bottle of water and got 34. Wells within 0-50. So I tried my water at various stages of clean. After the initial screens and uv-c light. It’s already 14-16. Add the extra filters and a pass through a brita filter and down to 11. Mom still not convinced hehe. Even aunts distilled water was only down to 7. So thought “let’s check the well water too!” Big mistake as the screen turned dark red as it displayed 1760 and basically told me to run.

So really cool and seems to work really well, didn’t even realize it had a temperature control feature, but the readability of the screen and size of the device are really nice and helped give me more comfort in my drinking water.

| "So I purchased this for aquarium use. You get quick readings when testing the TDS. I tested my tap water which came in at 30-34 ppm, which is the range I expected since I know for a fact that San Francisco water is known for good clean tap water and always drink it. I then wanted to test the temperature readings and it didn’t work at all. Cold water or hot water, it just gave me one reading. It only fluctuated once by one or two degrees from cold water to hot water. If it can’t get a simple temperature reading then I question how reliable the TDS reading actually is. I’ll probably buy a different meter to double check the accuracy because for now I can’t really trust it.

| "I  have had this unit for almost 2 years now, I will buy another. It literally saved my life!

If you work from home, like I do, then you need this unit or something like it. I had Radon levels above 7pCi/L and had been living with it without knowing it, for almost 3 years. For those that don't know, Radon is a radioactive breakdown of uranium, thorium, or radium in rocks, soil, and groundwater. The CDC and EPA claim that levels above 4pCi/L are considered highly toxic and proper mitigation should be taken to reduce the levels. This is why Radon mitigation systems are installed in nearly every home across the United States.

If you don't know, educate yourself about Radon and understand that radon causes over 21,000 lung cancer deaths in the United States each year and 2,900 of those deaths are people that have never smoked a day in their lives! For me, every now and then, I would cough and a small spat of blood would sometimes appear and i could never figure out why...

Now, do you NEED this system?

- Absolutely not, there are plenty of radon detectors out there and they are pretty cheap.

Why do I recommend this system and why did I choose it?

- Historical Data: This bad boy tracks all of your air quality metrics over time. This is extremely important when you want to understand cause and effect in anything in life. Many of the "bad reviews" talk about how some of the metrics displayed are inaccurate when compared to another device that specializes in one or many of the metrics this unit does display. Accurate comparisons only matter when comparing against a controlled environment and are purely for the sake of argument. This is important to understand because no unit needs to be 100% accurate, it just needs to be accurate to itself so that when you make a change, you can properly see that the change is affecting the metrics in a way that makes sense for what you meant to accomplish.
For example, I had high radon (the value of the metric didn't matter other than the fact that it is higher than 0... it's radioactivity, is anything above 0 TRULY acceptable?) When I installed my radon mitigation system, I could watch my Radon levels drop tremendously over time, which proved that my radon mitigation system was actually working as expected! Also, I haven't had any spots of blood appear when I cough... I call this a success.

- Dashboard: Airthings has a nice application and semi-customizable dashboard which makes viewing really easy to do, and from anywhere in the world. When my pets are home while the family is away, I can notify my neighbor to open a window to let some fresh air in, while we're away.

- Alerts: Always cool to have alerts so you don't even need to "monitor" the metrics. Fun fact, CO2 builds up pretty rapidly in a well-sealed home. When you go through insulation techniques to seal off cracks and crevices to improve your HVAC efficiency in the thermal zone, it is easy to forget that CO2 has no easy escape. Needless to say, this little guy alerted my phone and I was able to crack a window and keep my family safe. I later installed a fresh air intake on my HVAC system and again, could watch the metrics historically, as they fell to a more than acceptable range, yet again proving that my air intake installation was actually doing its job.

I hope this helps anyone looking to decide on this purchase. It has been an absolute godsend to have in our home and I didn't even get into some of the other things it helped me solve that had been plaguing us.

| "1. The app can be more optimized for the enhance. For example, the app does not show the remaining battery life which is on the web dashboard.
2. It maybe a good idea to add “identifying sensor” to the app. If consumer bought multiple units with the same looks, they can easily mixed up the sensors. It is difficult to tell which is which. For instance, the “find the sensor” may trigger the one to blink signal light. It is the feature I saw on my wifi mesh equipments.
3. It works without hub from my understanding. However, to get real time data, it requires a Airthings hub. I have a wave view plus at ground level, therefore, it was not an issue to me.

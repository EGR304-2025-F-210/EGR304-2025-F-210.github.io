| "How much is your home worth? How much is YOUR LIFE, and the lives of those you love, really worth? This dual-function unit would be worth the protection it provides at DOUBLE the price. It is SO simple to use, yet so much better than cheaper units. It will show a reading of gas on its continuous display, BEFORE the amount will set off the alarm! This make it superior to any kind of alarm I have ever purchased before. Do you use natural gas for cooking or heating in your home? Then why are you still just sitting there reading? You NEED this alarm. Stop thinking of the price difference, for crying out loud. Your home AND your life are both PRICELESS. Be smart and responsible. BUY THIS UNIT NOW!

| "I had an all home generator installed which included our propane company to come perform a leak check. They found a significant leak in my home and took measures to repair. They recommended I purchase a detector -- I informed them I had three (3) in my home; one on each floor. They gasped. I showed them where the main floor detector was plugged in -- again gasped. The service employee said the one of the three should absolutely have picked up the leak as one detector was right above the leak and the basement detector was right below. Never did either go off and I check the readout's constantly as they are in my sight when walking by. Not impressed . . . at all.

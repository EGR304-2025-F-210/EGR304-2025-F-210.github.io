| "How much is your home worth? How much is YOUR LIFE, and the lives of those you love, really worth? This dual-function unit would be worth the protection it provides at DOUBLE the price. It is SO simple to use, yet so much better than cheaper units. It will show a reading of gas on its continuous display, BEFORE the amount will set off the alarm! This make it superior to any kind of alarm I have ever purchased before. Do you use natural gas for cooking or heating in your home? Then why are you still just sitting there reading? You NEED this alarm. Stop thinking of the price difference, for crying out loud. Your home AND your life are both PRICELESS. Be smart and responsible. BUY THIS UNIT NOW!

| "I had an all home generator installed which included our propane company to come perform a leak check. They found a significant leak in my home and took measures to repair. They recommended I purchase a detector -- I informed them I had three (3) in my home; one on each floor. They gasped. I showed them where the main floor detector was plugged in -- again gasped. The service employee said the one of the three should absolutely have picked up the leak as one detector was right above the leak and the basement detector was right below. Never did either go off and I check the readout's constantly as they are in my sight when walking by. Not impressed . . . at all.

| "Wanted mom to drink my filtered water I get from my rain barrel and clean. Said store bought is better. I got several layers of filters to clean it more and she said no, but dad loved it. Then got a UV-C light to get 100% comfort on disinfection. Mom still said no.

So got this to prove the cleanliness of the water and checked a bottle of water and got 34. Wells within 0-50. So I tried my water at various stages of clean. After the initial screens and uv-c light. It’s already 14-16. Add the extra filters and a pass through a brita filter and down to 11. Mom still not convinced hehe. Even aunts distilled water was only down to 7. So thought “let’s check the well water too!” Big mistake as the screen turned dark red as it displayed 1760 and basically told me to run.

So really cool and seems to work really well, didn’t even realize it had a temperature control feature, but the readability of the screen and size of the device are really nice and helped give me more comfort in my drinking water.

How much is YOUR LIFE, and the lives of those you love, really worth? This dual-function unit would be worth the protection it provides at DOUBLE the price. It is SO simple to use, yet so much better than cheaper units. It will show a reading of gas on its continuous display, BEFORE the amount will set off the alarm! This make it superior to any kind of alarm I have ever purchased before. Do you use natural gas for cooking or heating in your home? Then why are you still just sitting there reading? You NEED this alarm. Stop thinking of the price difference, for crying out loud. Your home AND your life are both PRICELESS. Be smart and responsible. BUY THIS UNIT NOW!\" 1.  The product is very important for health and worth buying because life is priceless compared to product (explicit) Very flexible placement options. I bought this item to warn me about elevated propane levels near the gas dryer in my basement. As per the instructions, I placed the unit on the floor. To test it, I depressed the pin of a small Coleman propane gas cylinder that I held near the sensor. After a short while the sensor displayed \u201cgas\u201d on its screen and let out an alarm that could wake the dead. I feel protected. 2.  Customer can feel protected and have more safety (explicit) The Kidde Carbon Monoxide and Explosive Gas Detector is an absolute must-have for every household. Safety is non-negotiable, and this device provides peace of mind like no other. Right out of the box, setup is a breeze\u2014just plug it in, and you\u2019re protected. The digital display is clear and easy to read, providing real-time updates on CO and gas levels. What truly sets this apart is the dual detection for both carbon monoxide and explosive gases, ensuring comprehensive coverage in one compact device. During testing (using safe methods), the alarm proved to be both sensitive and reliable. The loud, piercing sound is impossible to miss, making it effective in alerting you and your family in case of danger. It\u2019s reassuring to know this device is constantly monitoring, even while we sleep. I also appreciate the sleek, unobtrusive design\u2014it blends seamlessly into any room while remaining highly functional. With Kidde\u2019s reputation for quality and reliability, I feel confident that this detector is working around the clock to protect my home and loved ones. Safety, simplicity, and top-notch performance\u2014this detector delivers it all. Don\u2019t wait until it\u2019s too late\u2014invest in this lifesaver today.

They found a significant leak in my home and took measures to repair. They recommended I purchase a detector -- I informed them I had three (3) in my home; one on each floor. They gasped. I showed them where the main floor detector was plugged in -- again gasped. The service employee said the one of the three should absolutely have picked up the leak as one detector was right above the leak and the basement detector was right below. Never did either go off and I check the readout's constantly as they are in my sight when walking by. Not impressed . . . at all.\" 1.  The kit is robust. (explicit) This thing came with pages and pages of information but absolutely nothing about how to remove the battery cover or how to set it up. I can\u2019t get the battery cover off, so I plugged it into the wall, but it just flashes a bunch of meaningless red symbols and then starts shrieking every few minutes. Apparently, it won\u2019t work without the backup battery, but with no way to install it, that makes it useless. I do NOT recommend it! How about including some detailed information about how to set up and use this device instead of telling me all about carbon monoxide for 15 pages? I already know that, it\u2019s why I bought this! I\u2019ll be looking for another brand. 2.  No normal information for the customer about battery(explicit) This product is an absolute joke. I don\u2019t know where Kidde is sourcing these, but mine reached its end of life in less than one week. That\u2019s right \u2013 a brand-new carbon monoxide and gas alarm already declared itself useless after only a few days of use. For something that\u2019s supposed to protect lives, this level of quality is completely unacceptable. I expected reliability and peace of mind, not a defective unit that dies right out of the box. Total waste of money and trust. Save yourself the frustration and buy literally any other brand. This one is worthless. 3.

She's noticed her kids have started to cough more often than usual, but they don't appear to be sick. After doing some research, she found that regulations about pollution are more relaxed in this new town compared to the rest of the country. She decides that someone needs to start monitoring the water for harmful pollutants before someone becomes seriously ill. However, no one is willing to support her investigation and she doesn't have enough money to hire a professional.</p> <p>Sarah finds a new water quality monitoring system that is easily affordable and decides to take it upon herself to monitor the water. She does not have any kind of technical background, so she normally wouldn't be able to understand what all of the water quality tests mean. This low-cost device allows her quickly and easily diagnose pollution issues that she can explain to her community. Her findings will not change regulations on their own, but the easy-to-understand readings will show her community the issues they are facing due to the relaxed regulations. She can use these findings to further her cause in updating the environmental regulations.</p> <p>User Story #2: Jimmy Jimmy is a 79-year-old retiree who has a number of medical issues.

However, due to time constraints and difficulties with the MPLAB IDE and compiler, we decided to switch our software over to a simple linear/monolithic system that used asynchronous digital high/low pins to transmit single-bit signals only, as opposed to the 8-bit system with UART.</p> <p>Our system's software evolved from a more complicated scope, where the controller board would also have a screen to display raw values sent from the sensor boards. Due to time and complexity constraints, this was also removed from the design, allowing a more streamlined execution. Since there was no menu or screen, the buttons on the controller board were remapped to starting and stopping the sensor boards directly without the intermediary of a menu software.</p> <p>Our systems use a simple initialization function provided by MPLAB, following which we set up our variables globally (from a design perspective, this is unecessary and unoptimal, but we seemed to run into many issues where compiled code behaved unexpectedly with the use of locally defined variables on the PIC microcontrollers, and this was a suitable workaround for our time constraints). Past this, we enter the main loop. </p> <p>For the sensor boards, the main loop involves waiting for a start signal. If the start signal is recieved (high value on the rx pin), the board reads the values of the sensor from the MCU's ADC module, performs the necessary math/logic against set calibrated values and determines whether the value of the sensor is dangerous or safe. The tx pin is set to high or low accordingly. The board's debug button can also trigger the start signal (through software) in the event of a failure in the controller.</p> <p>For the controller board, the main loop involves checking for a button press. Upon a button press, the 'active subsystem' represented by variable 'sys' (char) and the 'testing mode' flag represented by variable 'tst' (char) are set accordingly. After checking for the button state, if the testing mode flag is enabled, the controller will set it's appropriate header's TX pin to high for the selected sensor subsystem and set the other 2 TX pins to low. The controller then continiously reads the value of it's RX pin to get the sensor's danger or safe signals, and plays the appropriate speaker tone from a simple square wave created by setting a digital pin high or low with variable delays to generate different tones.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#top-5-changes-since-the-initial-software-proposal","title":"Top 5 Changes since the initial software proposal","text":"<p>Original proposal software files and diagrams can be found here - UART was switched to 1-bit communication for simplicity and challenges with MPLAB - Scheduling was switched to a single loop instead of interrupt-driven - All variables were declared globally to reduce compiler errors - The scope was reduced, eliminating the menu and LCD system to meet the time requirements of the project - Subsystem discovery was removed to further simplify the project and meet time requirements.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#requirements-conformity","title":"Requirements conformity","text":"<p>Our software proposal is capabable of meeting both the project and our own requirements. We are able to meet the requirements of a fast startup and calibration through parallizing our workload across the 4 PIC18F MCUs.

Our software design also meets the requirements of the project by being compilable from the Microchip MPLAB X IDE from C, utilizing a hub-and-spoke model, and performing DAC or ADC conversion on each subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#potential-improvements","title":"Potential Improvements","text":"<p>If a V2 version of the software was made, the following changes would be useful: - Improved efficiency through the use of interrupt-based scheduling and fast-to-sleep. - Switching to a communication protocol that allows for serial data transmission such as UART or SPI - Understanding the MPLAB/PIC18F compiler better to allow for common optimiziations that were ommited due to compiler trouble, such as heavier use of case statements instead of if statements to compile to more efficient jump tables, local variable declarations for reduced memory consumption and using two-bit datatypes for flags instead of the 8-bits currently used to further reduce memory consumption. - Heartbeat signals from the sensor boards which can be interpretted and used for both debugging and more complicated UI/control schemes, allowing the controller to identify which board is in which header slot arbitrarily.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix - Main Page","text":"<p>The Appendix is where supporting information goes that is not in the main body.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/","title":"Appendix: Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<ol> <li>Meets an actual market need (Not the digital/elecctronic equivalent of a Labubu)</li> <li>Is profitable (Whether we sell many units or high margin)</li> <li>Reasonable scope of project so we can finish it</li> <li>Improving skills in Embedded power systems </li> <li>Learning more about embedded systems, coding, sensors, and learning about smaller electronic devices rather than larger circuits, more solid state stuff.</li> </ol> <p>Our mission is to design and deliver a practical, market-relevant embedded power systems project that balances commercial viability with educational growth.

Need to learn more coding</p> <p>Since not everyone in our team was familiar with lots of coding in C language, we needed to make our subsystems work.</p> <p>2. Connecting with different microcontrollers</p> <p>It was very good learning for us about using 4 different microcontrollers and connecting those through DAC/ ADC and UART. By transmitting and receiving data in our subsystems, we learned a lot.</p> <p></p> <p>3. \u00a0Github datasheet It was a very interesting journey to work with GitHub and make updates to the website. We learned a lot about the Github throughout this semester. All of the updates to our subsystems were available online.  </p> <p>4. External Design Review Our team prepared very well to make the design review very good. We presented our project and datasheet well and received their feedback. We learned a lot about our components and about presenting our subsystem to the professionals and the teaching team. </p> <p>5. Time commitment This class requires at least 7 hours per week on average of time allocation to be able to successfully finish all assignments and make the subsystems work. There will be days and weeks when your team will need to meet more to discuss design review, subsystems coding. </p> <p>6. Nothing needs to be perfect We did not need to make the project perfect, but we did need to make it work and learn from it. We need to do our best and ensure that our subsystems work well. </p> <p>7. Showing up is required Many updates about the assignments and requirements for the subsystems are presented in class, and make sure that you do not miss any class or any lab. Even missing 1 class can make you behind of your project and lab. Do not come late, and if class finishes early, make sure that you try to spend to discuss team assignments and work on completing those. </p> <p>8. Following rubric Since many assignments have a fixed rubric, to maximize points, it is highly important that you try to follow all the requirements the assignment rubric says. Team assignments have big webpages with all the data about proper submission. We learned that everyone in the team needs to read it before starting the assignment, because it is very easy to miss a point or two. </p> <p>9. Start on breadbord Since the Peralta lab did not work, our PCB did not arrive on time, and we had to reorder through JLCPCB. We needed to make the breadboard work. We learned that putting our subsystem first on the breadboard before sending it to make a PCB would help us so much in the process of finding flaws before sending for PCB printout. </p> <p>10. Block diagram We needed to look over the block diagram as we had misalignments with what the PIC microcontroller has to offer. We believe that starting to work on our block diagram earlier would have been very benefitial, so we do not need to remake it. </p>"},{"location":"Appendix/Reflections/#recommendations-for-future-students","title":"Recommendations for future students","text":"<p>The following are Team VibeWater's top 5 recommendations for future students taking this class next semester.</p> <p>1. Send PCBs early. Since this class teaches the knowledge on how to make PCBs. You must start making your subsystem PCB early, and if you send it early to the Peralta lab, you will be on time for the hardware check-off. If you are taking this class in the fall, we would suggest making sure that you are ready for check off with PCB before Thanksgiving. </p> <p>2. Start Github assignments early Since you will most probably need to submit your datasheet assignments, your team needs to make sure that you do those assignments on time and submit them without flaws. You need to make sure that you use the Canvas link submission tool, which takes a snapshot of when your website was there. </p> <p>3. Communicate always Since you will be in a team of 4, communicating about updates to the assignments is important. Make sure that you meet every week to discuss assignments and assign tasks to each other to be on the same page. </p> <p>4. Attend office hours Office hours are constructive to learn about questions you have. Since you will need to make boards communicating with each other and make team block diagrams, you might have many questions when dealing with them. TAs and professors are very helpful during the office hours. </p> <p>5. Plan better: As our team chose a bit hard project, we sugegst to ensure that you make your project realistic, since you have other classes, work, and other things to do outside of this class. Ensure that whatever project you choose is either something you are passionate about or that you have an idea of what to do with it. </p>"},{"location":"Appendix/Resources/","title":"Resources","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/Resources/#show-of-complete-system-functionality","title":"Show of Complete-System Functionality","text":"The Subsystems Connected at the End of the Course <p>The video below shows the final state that we were able to acheive for our project. Unfortunately due to multiple class-wide setbacks, we as a team were unable to progress to finish it fully with final components to our Printed Circuit Boards or creating a model door to show ideal functionality. However, we did a lot of effort as we could with the time and resources we were given. Ultimately, we assembled our individual systems on breadboards, programmed them, and established full connectivity between all components. All four subsystems were integrated using a shared power source and communicated with one another to operate exactly as intended.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]}]}
